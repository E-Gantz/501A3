My initial design was to allow the user to create multiple separate objects, and then have each of them serialized. 
I then realised that the " Allow the user to create one or more objects from a selection of objects using some sort of text-based menu system or GUI" part of the assignment description probably meant that we create one object to serialize, and it can contain multiple other objects.
So, my first major refactoring was removing the user's ability to create multiple of the 5 types of objects, which involved removing loops and arraylists, minor renaming, and changing return types. (commit 4)
